# PostIt
PostIt is a simple web application that allows friends and colleagues create groups for notifications.
You can use the application by going to https://phemmz-post-it.herokuapp.com/

## Development

This application was developed using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com). PostgreSQL was used for persisting data with [Sequelize](https://http://docs.sequelizejs.com) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) and React-Redux for implementation of client side.

### Installation
1. Start up your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows OS).
2. Ensure that you have `node` installed on your PC.
3. Clone the repository by entering the command `git clone https://github.com/phemmz/PostIt/new/master` in the terminal.
4. Navigate to the project root folder using `cd PostIt` on your terminal (or command prompt).
5. After cloning, install the application's dependencies with the command `npm install`.
6. Create a `.env` file in your root directory as described in `.env.sample` file.
7. Variable such as DATABASE_URL (which must be a postgresql URL) is defined in the .env file and it is essential to create this file before running the application.
```
DATABASE_URL='postgres://jean:buck@localhost:5432/databaseName'
```
8. After this, you can start the server with the command: `npm start`.
